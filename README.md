# AdvancedPhysicsSolarSystem
Final for Game Physics - simulating a solar system in Unity with advanced physics and gravity. (Kind of ended up with a pendulum instead...)

The file labeled "PhysicsTest"  is what holds the Orbit Pattern using Transform Ver 2 as well as the reworking code of that into using pure gravity (slides 3 & 5 from the presentation). This also is what includes the addition of the moons orbiting a planet. (Use Enter on the keypad to spawn a new moon)

The other file labeled "SolarSystem" is our main file with the rest of our code. Charlies scene is the main scene that contains everything working in it.

To start the solar system/pendulum swing, press play in the editor and allow the planet to make its full transition through the center. To create the orbiting pattern, move the planet game object on the X or Z axis and allow the planet to continue its motion- now creating a pendulum pattern of rotation.
