# AdvancedPhysicsSolarSystem
Final for Game Physics - simulating a solar system in Unity with advanced physics and gravity. (Kind of ended up with a pendulum instead...)

The file labeled "PhysicsTest"  is what holds the Orbit Pattern using Transform Ver 2 as well as the reworking code of that into using pure gravity (slides 3 & 5 from the presentation). This also is what includes the addition of the moons orbiting a planet. (Use Enter on the keypad to spawn a new moon)

The other file labeled "SolarSystem" is our main file with the rest of our code. Charlies scene is the main scene that contains everything working in it.
